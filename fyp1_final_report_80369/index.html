<h1 id="abstract-abstract-unnumbered">ABSTRACT {#abstract .unnumbered}</h1>
<p>This project presents \"FindIt,\" an AI-driven mobile and web-based
application designed to address inefficiencies in item recovery within
university campuses. The system automates the matching of lost and found
items by leveraging image matching technology, which can significantly
reduce manual effort of both admin and students, and improving recovery
rates. Waterfall model is applied in this project to guide development,
and incorporating systematic phases such as requirements gathering,
design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. To understand the
critical issues with existing informal channels such as fragmented
reporting processes and lack of timely update, and the suitable features
to be included in the project, user feedback is collected via surveys in
Google Form. FindIt is designed to integrate a robust feature set
tailored for university students, likes AI-based image matching,
real-time notifications, and status tracking of reported items are
included in the mobile application. An administrator-focused web
interface is also designed to ensure an efficient management of claims
and user accounts. The system\'s effectiveness was evaluated through
functional and usability testing to highlights significant improvements
in item recovery efficiency, user satisfaction, and system reliability.
This project contributes to the application of AI in practical,
particularly in improving campus experiences.</p>
<h1 id="abstrak-abstrak-unnumbered">ABSTRAK {#abstrak .unnumbered}</h1>
<p>Projek ini memperkenalkan \"FindIt,\" sebuah aplikasi mudah alih dan
berasaskan web yang dipacu oleh AI, direka untuk menangani
ketidakefisienan dalam pemulihan barang hilang di kampus universiti.
Sistem ini mengautomatikkan padanan barang hilang dan ditemui dengan
memanfaatkan teknologi pemadanan imej, yang dapat mengurangkan usaha
manual oleh pentadbir dan pelajar, serta meningkatkan kadar pemulihan.
Model Air Terjun digunakan dalam projek ini untuk membimbing
pembangunan, dan menggabungkan fasa sistematik seperti pengumpulan
keperluan, reka bentuk, pelaksanaan, ujian, dan penyelenggaraan. Untuk
memahami isu kritikal dengan saluran tidak rasmi sedia ada seperti
proses pelaporan yang berpecah dan kekurangan kemas kini tepat pada
masanya, maklum balas pengguna dikumpulkan melalui tinjauan di Google
Form. FindIt direka untuk mengintegrasikan set ciri yang kukuh
disesuaikan untuk pelajar universiti, seperti padanan imej berasaskan
AI, pemberitahuan masa nyata, dan penjejakan status barang yang
dilaporkan dalam aplikasi mudah alih. Antara muka web yang berfokuskan
pentadbir juga direka untuk memastikan pengurusan tuntutan dan akaun
pengguna yang cekap. Keberkesanan sistem ini dinilai melalui ujian
fungsian dan kebolehgunaan untuk menekankan peningkatan ketara dalam
kecekapan pemulihan barang, kepuasan pengguna, dan kebolehpercayaan
sistem. Projek ini menyumbang kepada aplikasi AI dalam amalan,
terutamanya dalam meningkatkan pengalaman kampus.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-1-introduction-chapter-1-introduction-unnumbered">Chapter 1: Introduction {#chapter-1-introduction .unnumbered}</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>According to a study by Pixie Technology Inc., an average of 2.5 days
per year is spent on searching for the lost items (Habersham, 2021),
which wastes quite a vast amount of time, and the scenario is worse if
the items are not found on time. Obviously, the study shows that the
people are careless in handling personal items, and no doubt this
scenario applies to the students too.</p>
<p>Universities are huge and the students often have to travel to more than
one location within the campus or between campuses during the course of
one day. It can sometimes result in students misplace their personal
belongings or lose their valuable items and don't know where they lost
them. The current process to report and recover lost items is through
word-of-mouth or social media groups only which is not efficient and
reliable. These methods will cause a delay or failure of item retrieval.
Hence, it is essential to develop a system to meet the needs of the
university's students.</p>
<p>The system utilizes a mobile application for the owner to upload images
and item details of found items to enable the AI-driven image matching
model matching images with the list of found items uploaded. This will
help automate the matching of lost and found items by comparing the item
characteristics and analyzing the image, reducing the manual effort on
matching the possible lost and found items. In cases the image is
unavailable when reporting the lost items, system will compare and match
the items based on the item characteristics like item categories, item
colours and location of item lost or found.</p>
<p>Since timely notifications plays a significant role to enhance user
experience and satisfaction, the notification system will notify users
when there is any update regarding the status of the reported items, for
instances, when there is new potential matches or approval of claim from
the admin. The notifications will help reduce user's anxiety and
frustration and feel more secure regarding the recovery process. On the
other side, the admin plays the role to use web-based system to manage
the items and approve the claim of the items. By implementing this lost
and found system, there will be an improvement and increased efficiency
of the university's lost and found operations.</p>

<p>In UNIMAS, currently there is no centralized platform for the students
to report and recover lost items. Existing methods often relied heavily
on word-of-mouth, notification in students' social media groups, or
asking the staff about found items. This fragmented approach will delay
the recovery process or even worse the item will not be recovered
permanently (Anas et al., 2023) because it limits the visibility and
accessibility for the owner outside these informal channels. Another
problem is that the students can only report the lost items physically
during office hours and ask for help of other students in the social
media groups, leading to anxiety when they wait for updates.
Consequently, the owner can't get real-time notifications when the
similar item is found.</p>
<h2 id="project-scope">Project Scope</h2>
<p>The project involves developing both a mobile application and web-based
system for the users who are students and the admin respectively to
simplify the item recovery process in university by integrating an image
matching model. The system does not focus on verification for the
students' convenience, the mobile application, built with Dart and
Flutter, is designed exclusively for them to access the services anytime
and anywhere. Registration and login features are required in order to
use the system. The mobile app will allow the students to upload photos
if available and item descriptions in order to report the lost items or
found items. After this, the AI model have to take over the job to
compare the uploaded photos with the existing photos in the database to
display the potential matches results to both students and the admins if
there is any. Item characteristics will also be considered in matching
items. Next, the app will provide real-time notifications to inform the
owner whenever there is new potential match or the item is approved for
claiming. The student is allowed to request claiming the items not in
the match result too.</p>
<p>For the web-based system, which built with PHP and Laravel, is designed
for the administrator to manage the lost and found items. For instances,
the admin will have the rights to view, create, edit and delete the item
characteristics of the lost and found items. These item characteristics
are the predefined options that the students must select from when
reporting an item to ensure consistency and accuracy of the reporting
process. The system will also enable the admin to review the potential
matches given by the AI model and approve the claims. Apart from that,
the system will give admin the ability to manage user accounts, like
view, or delete the user account.</p>
<p>Finally, an API is developed as a central communication layer to ensure
the seamless data exchange between the mobile app, web-based system and
the database. The data stored in the database should include user
information, images and details of item, and the matching result.</p>
<p>The uploaded photos will be compared with the existing photos in the
database, and if there is any potential matches between the lost and
found items, the students and the admin will be notified. The owner can
request to claim the item from the list of potential matches or list of
found items manually.</p>

<h2 id="brief-methodology">Brief Methodology</h2>
<p>Waterfall is chosen as the methodology to manage this project. It is a
widely used project management method characterized by a sequential and
linear process (Hoory &amp; Bottorff, 2024). The methodology consists of 5
phases of management, where each phase requires a deliverable from the
previous phase before proceed to the next phases (Hoory &amp; Bottorff,
2024). The methodology emphasizes comprehensive documentation for each
phase which helps in maintaining the clarity throughout the software
development lifecycle (SDLC). Even though the effort of documenting the
project is cumbersome, but the detailed documentation helps tracking the
project's progress easier and simplifies software maintenance and
further improvement and modernization on the system (Nikitin, 2024).
This is one of the reason waterfall methodologies is suitable for the
project. Another reason is the methodology suitable for the project with
well-defined requirements (Nikitin, 2024) and requires upfront planning
which aligns well with academic requirements for project report.</p>
<p>Referring to figure 1.1, waterfall methodology consists of 5 phases,
requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/image3.png" />{width="3.3979166666666667in"
height="2.279861111111111in"}</p>
<p>[]{#_Toc187873530 .anchor}Figure 1.1: Phases in Waterfall Model (Hoory &amp;
Bottorff, 2024).</p>
<p>Phase 1: Requirements</p>
<p>This is the initial phase where all the project requirements are
gathered from the students in the university. The students will be
surveyed using questionnaire in Google Form to collect their insights
and relevant data. The requirements collected will be analyzed and they
should encompass the main functionalities of the system developed
(GeeksforGeeks, 2023). This phase is important to ensure the system
developed will be useful and meet the needs of the students.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Design</p>
<p>After the requirements is understood comprehensively, the next phase is
to design the system or solutions to meet the requirements. The system
design includes overall system architecture explaining the operation of
system at a macro level. The interaction between users with the system
will be illustrated using the use case diagrams, and then each
identified use case will be further developed to provide the details
descriptions in the use case specifications. Furthermore, activity
diagrams will be built to define the system's workflows and processes,
and class diagrams will outline the structure and relationships of the
system's components. Then, the wireframes for the mobile application and
mobile system will be designed. This phase serves as the guides for the
implementation phase (Laoyan, 2024).</p>
<p>Phase 3: Implementation</p>
<p>Based on the requirements collected and solutions in the previous 2
phase, the system is developed in this implementation phase. Each system
features will be developed one by one sequentially until forming a
complete system. To identify and resolve the issues or bugs which arise
throughout the development process, continuous testing are performed.</p>
<p>Phase 4: Verification</p>
<p>The system undergoes quality assurance during the verification phase
(Atlassian, n.d.), where functionality and usability testing are
conducted to ensure all the specified requirements and functions are met
correctly. Any identified issues and bugs are documented and addressed
in this phase.</p>
<p>Phase 5: Maintenance</p>
<p>The final phase is system maintenance. Continuous support for the
software, such as fixing bugs, implementing updates or improvements
based on the user feedback is critical to meet the evolving needs over
time. This phase emphasizes maintaining system stability and enhancing
functionality to keep the system reliable and effective.</p>
<h2 id="significance-of-project">Significance of project</h2>
<p>The project plays a crucial role to address the current challenges faced
by the students to recover the lost items conveniently and efficiently.
Currently there is no standard procedure or guideline for the students
to report the lost and found items, so the project helps in ensuring
organized and not scattered lost and found information by providing a
centralized platform to locate all of them in one platform. The students
will no longer need to search for information across different sources
like social media, messaging application, or word-of-mouth. Instead, the
system will allow students to report and search items in one place,
avoiding any key information of the lost item is overlooked.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the project important in reducing the time and effort
of the users to find a list of potential matches from a large amount of
found items. With AI-driven image matching, visual characteristics of
the item in the image will be compared automatically, bypassing the need
for users to find the lost items by manually sifting through every found
items, but instead focusing on the items which has been identified as
potentially matched. This can greatly speed up the process of recovering
the item. The redundancy of checking if the same item matched with the
new report can be minimized since the system will take the roles
actively monitoring the new reports, generating the potential matches
automatically. This approach will keep the users away from committing
extra effort since the system will "do the searching and matching".</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>There will be 3 similar existing systems analyzed in this section, they
are "Lost and Found", "Lost'NFound" and "Lost and Found Network". Their
features will be discussed in the following section.</p>
<h3 id="lost-and-found">Lost and Found</h3>
<p>Lost and Found is a mobile application offered by Techju, designed as a
community driven project to help users in recovering their misplaced or
lost belongings via community support. (<em>Lost and Found - Apps on Google
Play</em>, 2024). The application aims to improve trouble-free lost and
found process by streamlining the process of recovering the lost items.
In addition to retrieve the lost items, the platform promotes the
communal awareness and a sense of responsibility for the people using it
(<em>Lost and Found - Apps on Google Play</em>, 2024).</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc187863418 .anchor}Figure 2.1: Registration.</p>
<p>Before the users can start using all the functions provided by the
platform, registration is necessary. A non-registered user is not
allowed to report and post the lost and found information in the system.
Referring Figure 2.1, the name, email address, phone number, and
password need to be provided to complete the registration process.</p>
<p><strong><br />

<p>[]{#_Toc187863419 .anchor}Figure 2.2: Login.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 2.2, the registered user can then login before
proceed to use the system. User can reset the password in case they
forget the password by clicking on the "Forget Password" option. The
user can prefer to sign in with google to save time by reducing the
hassle of creating and managing new account.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc187873533 .anchor}Figure 2.3: Browse item by category (lost
items &amp; found items).</p>
<p>From Figure 2.3, all the items reported in the system are listed under 2
main categories which are "lost items" and "found items". This can help
users to locate the desired lost and found information quickly and
effectively. Users can navigate to the "lost items" category to put
effort helping others find their belongings, or navigate to the "found
items" category to check if the lost item was found by others.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc187879172 .anchor}Figure 2.4: Filter option.</p>
<p>Filter can be applied to a search to refine the search results,
returning the possible match of items efficiently. For example, users
are allowed to filter the search results by specify the country, and
category as depicted in Figure 2.4. "Country" filter will ensure the
lost or found items searched and returned are within a specific country
while 'category' filter specifying the type of items searched to exclude
irrelevant results.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc187863422 .anchor}Figure 2.5: Browse item.</p>
<p>Figure 2.5 shows that the user can browse the brief item's metadata such
as the item image, name, item description, country, and the username.
The user can prefer to report the lost or found item here by clicking on
the "+" button so that they can quickly post the item information here
if the desired lost or found item is not identified.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc187863423 .anchor}Figure 2.6: View item details.</p>
<p>Figure 2.6 illustrates all the item details displayed to the users, such
as location where the item is found, contact information of the person
who upload the item, item category and offered reward. This information
is useful to match the item with the rightful owners.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc187877952 .anchor}Figure 2.7: Browse item lost nearby and
recently.</p>
<p>Figure 2.7 depicts that the system offers features for the users to
browse the latest lost and found item. It can save the time and effort
by reducing the possibility of searching through the outdated entries or
records. Apart from that, the system enable the users to browse the lost
and found items in their vicinity, providing convenience to the users.</p>

<p>From Figure 2.8, users are required to provide the item image, item
name, phone number, reward to the person who find it if any, item
category, date, location and item description when publishing a lost or
found item on the platform. The comprehensive information provided will
maximize the chance of reuniting the items with the owner. The platform
allows users to pin a location in the map to show a more accurate
reference point for others.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths of Lost and Found</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in using Google</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The "Sign in with Google" functionality help simplify the process of
registration, as the user no longer need to provide their name, email
address, phone number, password and more personal details. The feature
also simplifies the login process by eliminating the needs to remember
separate credentials for the mobile application, allowing users to
login with the same credentials as their Google account. Apart from
that, this feature applies Google Authenticate to adds an additional
layer of security when the user login.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Weaknesses of Lost and Found</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No email verification upon account registration (excluding "sign in
  with google" is inherently secure)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>After the user had registered an account, no authentication code is
sent to their email for verification purpose which may lead to
duplicate accounts with invalid email addresses, affecting the
platform's reliability. A valid email is important for the user to
receive notifications like item match alerts and password reset. This
could compromise the integrity of the lost and found process,
preventing the users from registering an account since the malicious
users had register fake accounts using the legitimate email addresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lostnfound">Lost'NFound</h3>
<p>The Lost'NFound mobile application connect together the item owner who
lost the item and the finder. GPS technology is utilized in this mobile
application to assist the users to find the lost and found item more
conveniently by showing all the items reported lost or found nearby to
the user location (<em>Lost and Found - Apps on Google Play</em>, 2023). The
app emphasizes on the privacy of the users since the user don't have to
register to use the mobile apps (<em>Lost and Found - Apps on Google Play</em>,
2023). Hence, communication take place without personal information
revealed to others.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/image14.jpeg" />{width="1.6194444444444445in"

<p>[]{#_Toc187863428 .anchor}Figure 2.11: Browse lost and found item.</p>
<p>Figure 2.11 showcases homepage of the application where all the item
reported lost or found near the user location are displayed. The items
are divided into 2 main sections, which are "found items" and "lost
items". If the user would like to view the lost and found item not in
their current location, they can choose a different location rather than
their current location by clicking on the address shown in the top part
of Figure 2.11.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/image15.jpeg" />{width="1.5777777777777777in"

<p>[]{#_Toc187863429 .anchor}Figure 2.12: Filter by location.</p>
<p>Figure 2.12 clearly illustrates that the user can switch their current
location by pinpointing the desired location in the map. The red pin in
the map can be dragged and moved to any location. The item lost and
found near the latest location pinned in the map will be returned in the
search result after the "add location" is clicked.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/image16.jpeg" />{width="1.6736111111111112in"

<p>[]{#_Toc187863430 .anchor}Figure 2.13: Search and filter.</p>
<p>As depicted in Figure 2.13, Lost'NFound mobile application provides a
feature to search specific items with an accurate location as the
filter. Normally other lost and found system only allow to apply filter
of broader categories such as country and city, but not accurate up to
an exact location. This functionality is achieved by allowing the users
to pin the location on the map.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/image17.jpeg" />{width="1.5909722222222222in"

<p>[]{#_Toc187873544 .anchor}Figure 2.14: Message finder or owner.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 2.14, the "Message" button is available for the users
to click on to start communicating with the finder or owner of the
items. The communication happens in the app, and no personal information
such as the phone number and email addresses will be shared or leaked to
the other party in this process.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="media/image18.jpeg" />{width="1.4479166666666667in"

<p>[]{#_Toc187863434 .anchor}Figure 2.17: Delete item.</p>
<p>Figure 2.17 showcases that the user can delete the item they have posted
in the platform after a successful retrieval process. There is no option
to edit the item information and the only choice is to delete the post
and create a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths of Lost'NFound</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pin location to filter search results</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The geolocation feature enables the users to pin a specific location
on the map as a filter for the search results. It has improved the
system usability and effectiveness because this is an intuitive way
for users to visualize and select locations with greater precision.
Normally other systems only offer filter option of country, state, or
city, not accurate up to specific area. An accurate location filter
ensures a high accuracy search, which aids in narrowing down the
search results to those closest to the pinned location and hence saves
time to identify desired posts of lost or found item information.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No exposure of private contact information</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no user's contact details like email addresses and phone
number displayed in the lost or found item information to keep their
private information secure. To achieve this, in-app chat feature is
provided to ensure secure communication between the users. Thus, any
potential risks of harassment and spam will be avoided, encouraging
the users to interact with each other without any concern of exposing
any sensitive data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Weaknesses of Lost'NFound</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Too few filter option available for searching items</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The system only offers one filtering options for searching, which can
hinder the user from getting the best out of the search. For instance,
there is no option to filter by category, meaning users cannot opt to
see results by item type. This limitation contributes to a longer
search time to filter through unrelated results, negatively affecting
the overall efficiency and user experience with the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Item information cannot be edited, only option to delete is available</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The system does not allow users to update or modify the information of
an item once it has been posted. The only option available is to
delete the post and create a new post entirely if there is any errors
or needs to update the item details ensuring most up-to-date
information. This shortcoming reduces the system usability and user
satisfaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lost-and-found-network">Lost and Found Network</h3>
<p>Lost and Found Network is a global search engine for lost and found
information developed by Greenitco Technologies Pvt Ltd (About Us,
2024). The system can be accessed in both form of website and mobile
application, catering to a broader audience. This dual-platform
availability improves the accessibility significantly, allowing seamless
interaction with the system and providing convenience for users with
different preferences (Jones, 2024). It has even provided a Facebook
page where the lost and found information is shared to increase the
exposure and reach broader audiences and those who are hard-to-reach
(Petkovic et al., 2021).</p>

items as shown in Figure 2.25. To initiate the chat, the user simply
needs to enter the phone number and messages. Alternatively, the user
can call the advertiser directly if the situation is emergency since the
phone number is provided in the item listing details.</p>
<p>Strengths of Lost &amp; Found Network</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide official social media page for higher exposure of information</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The system owns a social media page where the lost and found
information will be posted on it to help increase the visibility,
ensure reaching the audience not actively use the application itself.
The social media posts can be shared easily and circulated among a
wider network, positively increasing the chance of recovering the lost
items.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More filter option (i.e. by the number of days since an item was<blockquote>
<p>posted)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Lost &amp; Found Network adds usability by allowing people to filter the
items based on the days since the items were posted. This helps users
find what they need faster without having to wade through potential
item information in a large database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weaknesses of Lost &amp; Found Network</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for approval before the item details publicly visible</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The system requests the users to go through an approval process to
make the item details visible. Although this step may help ensure the
integrity and authenticity of the item information shared on the
system, it can lead to delays, especially in contexts that are urgent
where people need immediate visibility of their lost or found items.
The waiting period might affect the overall user experience and
satisfaction for the students who are in a urgent situation.</p>

</table>

<p>Based on Table 2.1, 'Lost and Found Network' has the most features among
the existing systems while 'Lost and Found' and 'Lost'NFound; have the
least features among the existing system. All the existing systems have
provided all the basic features required in a lost and found system like
manage, search, filter and browse the lost and found information. 'Lost
and Found network' has some special feature that other 2 existing
systems does not offer. One of them is receiving approval to list the
item and make it publicly visible to all the users. Another feature is
that the ability for the user to receive email notifications from the
system.</p>
<p>The proposed system, 'FindIt' supports Android platform only and is
specifically designed for university students, whereas the existing
systems focus on public and supports platforms, including Android, iOS,
and websites. By focusing on university students as the target audience,
the system will be more tailored to their needs. The system provides
most of the main features offered by the existing systems and offers a
few improvements over the existing system as shown in the Table 2.1.
Firstly, 'FindIt' introduces a special feature not found in the existing
system, etc. image matching between the lost and found items. The
feature will help improve the efficiency in item recovery thanks to the
automation in matching the items using images. Moreover, 'FindIt' allows
the students to track the status of the reported items and request for a
claim, ensuring the lost and found process is transparent and
structured. Unlike some of the existing systems, 'FindIt' does not
provided features to send message to other users in the system. This is
because no necessity for communication between the students since all
the found item will be returned to the admin temporarily before the true
owner is identified. Additionally, 'FindIt' does not request the
students to receive approval for item listings because this will consume
more time for the recovery process, affecting the efficiency of the
systems badly. Overall, the proposed system is a competitive and
innovative solution to be implemented in university campus for the
students.</p>
<h2 id="review-on-technologies-and-tools-used-in-development">Review on Technologies and Tools used in Development</h2>
<h3 id="laravel">Laravel</h3>
<p>Laravel is an open-source and powerful PHP framework designed to
streamline the process of developing the web applications. The framework
follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture which separate the
development process into three interconnected components: model, view
and controller (Fastfwd, 2022). This approach will help to produce
organized and maintainable code. With its eloquent Object-Relational
Mapping system, the developer can interact with the database using PHP
syntax, avoid using the complex SQL queries (Fastfwd, 2022). It can save
a lot of time to access and query the database. Laravel also includes
the feature which is the blade templating engine which allow the
developers to create lightweight template for the web pages easily
(Fastfwd, 2022). It is well-suited to develop the website of the
proposed system: FindIt since Laravel provide an extensive list of
powerful features.</p>
<h3 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h3>
<p>Bootstrap is a CSS framework aims to simplify web design by providing a
collection of easy-to-use tools. Responsive grid system, pre-designed
components and customized utilities are provided to help developers
quickly creating web design that can adapt to device with different size
seamlessly. There are also some JavaScript plugins provided in the
framework (GeeksforGeeks, 2024b). With these amazing features provided,
quick development of professional-looking web design is possible since
the developers no longer need to design the webpage from scratch and
instead use the pre-designed components which ensure consistency design
across different webpage (GeeksforGeeks, 2024b). Therefore, more effort
can be assigned to content creation and logic implementation.</p>
<h3 id="flutter">Flutter</h3>
<p>Flutter is a framework built on Dart, designed for building
platform-independent mobile apps. It supports cross-platform development
where the developers can design single code producing apps that can
operate on different platforms, like Android, iOS, desktop and web.
Flutter includes integrated tools for testing and debugging, allowing
developers to quickly identify and address any problems during
development process. Besides, key features of Flutter encompass the
accessibility to native features, and customized widgets and tools which
are all important factors of building a visually appealing and highly
functional mobile apps (Onipe, 2023).</p>
<h3 id="laragon">Laragon</h3>
<p>Laragon is a simple, modern and flexible Windows development server
which integrates a few programming languages, database management tools,
DNS services, web servers and terminal emulators to ease the software
development process for PHP and Node JS applications. For example, PHP,
Apache, Nginx, MySQL, Node JS are provided. Laragon provides a
user-friendly interface where the developers can control all the
software it manages such as turn on or off the server processes. Manual
efforts are greatly reduced since Laragon is responsible to configure
the necessary files and updates system paths automatically once
switching between different versions of the extensions happened
(Karunaratne, 2022). This tool is definitely a good option to run and
debug the system in the development server.</p>
<h3 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a code editor that offers a vast array of features
in the form of plugins which the developers can install to their
development environment according to their demands and requirements. Its
cross-platform compatibility supports installation on different
platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux. Visual Studio Code ships
with Node.js, Typescript, Javascript in default, while its extension
ecosystem supports for different programming languages such as Python,
C++, Java, C#, PHP and etc (<em>Visual Studio Vs Visual Studio Code -
What's Best in 2024?</em>, 2024). It is suitable for this project due to its
ease of use, extensibility, and flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="tensorflow">TensorFlow</h3>
<p>TensorFlow is an open-source framework introduced by Google to build
different machine learning and deep learning models. It is primarily
used to perform computations on big numerical datasets (Banoula, 2024).
These computations refer to two main processes in machine learning and
deep learning: training and inference. TensorFlow was intended to run on
many CPUs or GPUs, and increasingly many mobile operating systems
(<em>Introduction to TensorFlow and Keras --- Deep Learning With
TensorFlow</em>, n.d.). TensorFlow can also be used to access and integrate
the pre-trained model into the proposed system (<em>Transfer Learning and
Fine-tuning</em>, 2024).</p>
<h3 id="fastapi">FastAPI</h3>
<p>FastAPI is a high-performance web framework enabling developers to build
APIs with Python. As one of the fastest web frameworks available, it can
process multiple requests at the same time. Its Python 3.7++
capabilities allow the creation of reliable APIs with little code. It
has offered powerful features like generating documentation
automatically for APIs using Swagger UI and ReDoc based on the type
hints and docstrings in the code, which reduces development time and
increases API comprehension. Additionally, it also helps in data
validation as it automatically validates request and input data,
ensuring consistency and reducing errors (Simplilearn, 2024). For these
reasons, it is chosen to build the API for the AI model, enabling
seamless communication between the system and AI model.</p>
<h3 id="android-studio">Android Studio</h3>
<p>Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
for developing android mobile apps (<em>Download and Install Android Studio
| Android Developers</em>, 2024). The emulator that comes with Android
Studio enables developers to test their applications in a simulated
environment that mirrors real Android devices. It is available in many
screen sizes, resolutions and Android versions for testing purposes
(<em>Run Apps on the Android Emulator</em>, 2024). Besides its powerful
emulator, Android Studio also provides a unified environment where
developers can build, test and debug applications for all Android
devices (<em>Meet Android Studio</em>, n.d.). This combination caters to every
aspect of the development process which minimizes the use of multiple
tools.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, a comprehensive review of three existing systems along with
the proposed system are carried out in this chapter. The features,
strengths and limitations of the existing systems are being discussed
and analyzed. Then, the features of the existing systems and proposed
system are compared. Additionally, the software tools used to develop
the proposed lost and found system, including Laravel, Bootstrap,
Flutter, Laragon, Visual Studio Code, TensorFlow, FastAPI, Android
Studio, are reviewed.</p>

<h1 id="system-analysis-and-design">System Analysis and Design</h1>
<h2 id="introduction_2">Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter discusses in detail the phases involved in the Waterfall
Model software development methodology. The selection of methodology is
crucial to define the systematic procedures to deliver a functional
system within the specified timeframe. Figure 3.1 presents the phases of
the Waterfall Model. The focus of this chapter will be placed on the
first two phases, namely requirement analysis and system design, while
the overview of the subsequent phases like implementation, verification
and maintenance will be provided in this chapter.</p>
<p>The requirement analysis phase has been divided into two sub-works,
namely: Data Analysis and System Requirements Analysis. Data Analysis
would involve questionnaire distributions to gather information whereby
the data extracted will be subjected to detailed analysis for meaningful
findings and identification of system requirements. In the system
requirement analysis phase of software development, use case diagram is
used to visualize the functional requirements of a system by
illustrating the interactions between users (actors) and the system,
ensuring all functional requirements are accounted for. For the system
design phase, the focus is to develop comprehensive diagrams and
documentation of the proposed system, such as a system architecture
diagram, activity diagram, class diagram and wireframe.</p>

that all the requirements are captured accurately.</p>
<h3 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h3>
<p>Questionnaire is distributed to the respondents through Google Form to
collect relevant data for analysis. The questionnaire is attached in
APPENDIX B for reference. The target audience of this questionnaire is
any undergraduate students in UNIMAS. The questionnaire was divided into
three sections: Section I Demographics, Section II Current Experience
and Challenges Faced, and Section III Desired Features and Feedback.
Section I aims to collect the demographic details of the respondent,
Section II aims to understand reasons of developing the proposed system
while Section III aims to identify the necessary requirements to be
included in the system and collect feedback from the respondents
regarding the proposed system. A total of 33 respondents had answered
the questionnaire and the data collected are presented in chart form for
better analysis.</p>

Feature for the Proposed System.</p>
<p>The chart represents the results asking respondents choosing the 5
features they think will be the most helpful in a lost and found system.
Figure 3.15 depicts that most popular features among the respondents
(over 70%) are reporting lost and found items, auto matching between
lost and found items, push notifications for potential matches between
lost and found items, and tracking the status of reported items. The
moderately popular features chosen from the respondents (60-70%) are
browsing lost or found items, and search and filter item. Lastly, the
less popular features include registration and login, and viewing claim
history.</p>

Automatic Matching and Notification Features.</p>
<p>Almost all the respondents (93.9%) would be more interested in using the
proposed lost and found system if automatic matching between lost and
found items and notifications features are provided in the system as
shown in Figure 3.16, showing a strong preference for these features.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc187864207 .anchor}Figure 3.17: Analysis on User Concerns about a
Lost and Found System.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 3.17, there are a total of 8 responses given by the
respondents for this open-ended question. 3 of the respondents show no
concern over a lost and found system. One of the respondents expresses
concern about the potential misuse of personal information shared within
the system and whether non-students can access the system. This
highlights the importance of preventing unregistered users to access the
system. Furthermore, concerns are raised about the usability of the
system. Hence, it is vital to ensure that the user interface is
user-friendly. Another respondent asks about methods to reduce false
claims. These concerns point to the need for a role takes part in
approve the claim of an item.</p>
<p>The data collected from the questionnaire during the system requirement
analysis phase has given rich information that shall be helpful in
developing the lost and found system. A number of key features are
identified from the analysis, which should form part of the design of
the system. The system should focus on the implementation of a
user-friendly interface so as to ensure access and ease of use by the
students. The questionnaire responses reveal a high demand for efficient
reporting and tracking mechanisms regarding lost and found items.
Moreover, the majority of respondents strongly preferred automated
features such as the capability of item matching and push notification
system in order to notify users about the potential match.</p>
<p>Security aspects emerged as a significant concern, so it is necessary to
restrict system access to registered users only. Additionally, an
approval mechanism should be integrated to validate item claims,
maintaining the system\'s integrity by preventing fraudulent claims.</p>
<p>The system has, therefore, been designed keeping in mind such basic and
popular features as browsing, searching, and filtering. However,
additional functionalities can be provided: user registration, login
system, and tracking of previous claims. The implementation of these
features derived from the questionnaire analysis will ensure the system
effectively addresses user requirements, and enhance user satisfaction
towards the system.</p>
<h3 id="system-requirement-analysis">System Requirement Analysis</h3>
<p>A use case diagram helps identify functional requirements since it shows
the interaction of the system with its users, or actors. In this way, it
is easy to understand what the system is supposed to do for each actor.
Each use case corresponds to a specific functional scenario that the
system needs to support. Since the mapping between the actor and use
cases are displayed clearly, a clear outline of the functionalities is
available and hence no critical functions will be missing in the
requirement analysis phase.</p>

<h2 id="system-design-phase">System Design Phase</h2>
<p>The focus of the system design phase is to convert requirements into
blueprints which can guide the development process. Designs like system
architectural design, activity diagram and class diagrams are created in
this phase. System architectural design is developed to provides a
high-level structure of the system, showing the interactions between
different system components. Apart from that, activity diagram is built
to illustrate the system workflow clearly and help to understand more
complex system logic with more ease. Finally, class diagram is designed
to outline the system structure clearly by modeling the classes,
attributes, methods and relationships between classes.</p>

Proposed System (FindIt).</p>
<p>Figure 3.19 shows the system architecture design for the proposed
system, FindIt. There are 2 types of users in this system which are
admin and student. Admin use website interface to access the system
while student use mobile interface to access the system. A backend
server is ready to accept the request from both admin and students and
return corresponding data or results. Besides that, the web server also
will store and protect the data. Furthermore, users interact indirectly
with the shared database via backend server which plays the role to
communicates with the shared database to store and retrieve data.
Lastly, backend server plays the role to send request to api server to
access the AI model when backend server receive request which needs the
power of AI model, compare image and calculate similarity score in this
case.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc187863476 .anchor}Figure 3.34: Class Diagram of Proposed System.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>A class diagram is used to represent the structure of the system by
giving details about the entities, attributes, methods and relationship
between entities. As shown in Figure 3.34, there are nine classes
involved in the class diagram, including "Students", "Admins", "Items",
"Locations", "Categories", "Colors", "Claims", "Matches" and
"Notifications".</p>
<p>The "Student" class contains attributes such as "student_id",
"matric_no", "name", "email", "password", "email_verified_at",
"created_at", "updated_at", with methods "claims()", "notifications()",
and "items()" which retrieves the claims made, notifications received
and items reported by the student. Class "Students" establishes a
one-to-many composition relationships with the class "Claims", indicated
by the "1" on Students side and "0...*" on the Claims side because
each student can claim none or more found item, while one claim can only
be initiated by one student. The composition relationship between the
classes shows that a claim cannot exist without the existence of a
student. Meanwhile, the "Students" class has a one-to-many compositions
relationships to the "Items" class,with "1" on Student side, and
"0...*" on Items side because each student can report none or many
items in the system, while an item can only be reported by one student
only. The composition relationship depicts that items cannot without the
context of user.</p>
<p>The "Notifications" class contains attributes such as "notification_id",
"student_id", "message", and "created_at". The methods "student()" is
used to retrieve the students who had received the notifications. Class
"Notifications"maintains a many-to-one composition relationships with
the "Student" class, indicated by the "0...*" on Notifications side
while "1" on Student side. It is because each student can receive none
or more notifications, while one notification only sent to one student.
The composition relationship shows a notification cannot exist without
the linked student.</p>
<p>The "Admin" class has attributes like "admin_id", "name", "email",
"password", "created_at", and "updated_at". The class includes methods
"claims()" retrieving all the claims approved or rejected by the admin.
Class "Admin" has a one-to-many relationships with "Claims" table, where
the cardinality is "0...*" on Claims side and "1" on Admin side
because each admin can approve/ reject none or many claims, while a
claim can only be approved/ rejected by one admin only.</p>
<p>The "Claims" class has attributes like "claim_id", "match_id",
"lost_item_id", "found_item_id", "student_id", "admin_id", "status",
"user_justification", "admin_justification", "created_at" and
"updated_at". Methods included in the class are "students()", "admin()",
"lostItem()", "foundItem()" and "match()". They are responsible to
retrieve the students who made the claim, admin who approve or reject
the claim, the lost item involved in the claim, the found item involved
in the claim, and also the match which triggers the claim respectively.
"Matches" class has a one-to-one relationship with "Claims" class,
indicated by "0...1*" on both side of Matches and Claims because each
match can be ignored or accepted by the user one time only, if the claim
based on the matches is rejected by the admin, the student cannot submit
claim based on the rejected matches again. Also each claim can only
involves none or one match only because a claim not necessary submitted
based on a potential match suggested by the system.</p>
<p>The class "Matches" contains attributes like "match_id", "lost_item_id",
"found_item_id", "similarity_score", "status", "created_at" and
"updated_at", with methods "lostItem()", "foundItem()" and "claim()"
"Items", with the roles to retrieve the lost and found item involved in
a match, and also the claim triggered by the match respectively. Class
"Items" has a one-to-many composition relationships with "Matches" table
for a single lost item, indicated by "1" on Items side and "0...*" on
Matches side. This is because each lost item can be involved in none or
many potential matches generated by the system, while a match must
involve one lost item. Next, "Items" class has a one-to-many composition
relationships with "Matches" class for a single found item, indicated by
"1" on Items side and "0...*" on Matches side because each found item
can be involved in none or many potential matches generated by the
system, while a match must involved one found item. The composition
relationships shows that the matches will be removed from the system
once the item involved in the matches is removed.</p>
<p>The class "Items" contains attributes such as "item_id", "name",
"description", "image", "image_embeddings", "type", "status",
"category_id", "color_id", "location_id", "student_id", "created_at",
"updated_at", and methods such as "student()", "category()", "color()",
"location()", "matches()", and "claims()". These methods allow to
retrieve the student who reported the item, category and color of the
item, location of the item lost or found, matches which involves the
item, and also claims involves the item. "Items" class has a one-to-many
relationships with "Claims" class for single found item, indicated by
"0...*" at Claims side and "1" at Items side because each found item
can be claimed by none or many students at the same time, while a claim
must mention which found item would be claimed by the student.
Furthermore, "Items" class has a one-to-many relationships with "Claims"
table for single lost item, indicated by "0...*" at Claims side and
"0...1" at Items side . This is because every claim may not include a
reported lost item because the student can directly submit claim request
for a specific found item without reporting a lost item.</p>
<p>Class "Locations", "Colours" and "Categories" have attributes like
"location_id", "colour_id", and "category_id" respectively, and have
common attributes "name", "created_at", "updated_at" with a method
"items()" to retrieve items associated with these classes. The
relationships are shown as aggregation, where locations, colors, and
categories can exist independently but are used to classify multiple
items. The relationship between these classes and class "Items" is
one-to-many, indicated by "1" on Locations, Colours and Categories side,
and "0..*" on "Items" side. This is because many items may be located
at the same place, can be under the same category, and also share the
same color. On the other hand, each item can only be reported lost or
found at only one specific location, classified under one category, and
associated with only one primary color.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-phase">Implementation Phase</h2>
<p>The development of the system for lost and found begins right after the
phase of system design. This is the implementation phase where coding is
necessary for the translation of the system design into an effective
application. The proposed system will be both a mobile and a web app. In
developing the web application, the front-end pages will be built using
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>The mobile application will be done using Flutter, which gives an
intuitive, responsive UI for mobile use. An API endpoint will be
attached to the back-end server that connects through the API,
facilitating the communication of the mobile application with the
backend for actions: registering an item; an image-matching request
coming from the user\'s side; and approvals by admins.</p>
<p>The proposed backend server will be powered by the Laravel framework,
which will handle all the server-side activities: processing the
requests, interaction with the database, and execution of the image
matching algorithm. A database will be set up for storing information
regarding users, item details, image information, and match results. It
will also run on the API server: hosting the pre-trained AI model for
doing image comparisons that could suggest possible matches of
lost-found pairs. The AI model connects with the back-end server for
automated matching.</p>
<h2 id="verification-phase">Verification Phase</h2>
<p>This stage is focused on validating whether the system meets its
requirements or not. Accordingly, test cases are designed based on the
system. Also, the functional testing ensures that main features are
functioning according to specifications and the usability testing will
make the user interface of the system in an accessible manner. This
ensures that the system is on target and also delivers initial design
and requirement by users.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance-phase">Maintenance Phase</h2>
<p>This is the phase where all the bugs encountered will be addressed to
ensure user satisfaction and prolongs the system's lifespan.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion_1">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In short, requirement analysis and system design phases of the Waterfall
model is discussed in detailed in Chapter 3 which facilitate the
development of the system in Chapter 4. In the requirement analysis
phase, undergraduate students in UNIMAS are taken as the sample for the
questionnaire to gather system requirements. Apart from that, use case
diagram and use case specifications are built to ensure critical
functionalities of the systems are considered and not missed. In the
system design phase, system architectural design, activity diagrams, and
class diagrams are designed. Furthermore, wireframes are designed to
outline the user interface of the proposed system. This chapter ends
with brief introduction to the other phases taken part in Waterfall.</p>
